 * Changes the permission of a specific file/directory of specified path.

 *
 * The mode is a sequence of 3 octal numbers. The first/left-most number
 * specifies the permissions for the owner. The second number specifies the
 * permissions for the group. The last/right-most number specifies the
 * permissions for others. For example, with a mode of 0o764, the owner (7)
 * can read/write/execute, the group (6) can read/write and everyone else (4)
 * can read only.
 *
 * | Number | Description |
 * | ------ | ----------- |
 * | 7      | read, write, and execute |
 * | 6      | read and write |
 * | 5      | read and execute |
 * | 4      | read only |
 * | 3      | write and execute |
 * | 2      | write only |
 * | 1      | execute only |
 * | 0      | no permission |

 * ```
 *
 * @tags allow-write
 *
 * @param path The path to the file or directory.
